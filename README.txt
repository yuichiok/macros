THIS IS README.txt FOR ROOT MACROS.

ExampleData.C		--- Simple macro in order to plot data taken from expdata.txt
ExampleData.txt		--- Input data for ExampleData.C. From left column they represent x/y/ex/ey.
Flux.C			--- Calculation/fit/plot of flux of muon on the detector.
hello.c			--- Calculation/fit/plot of efficiency of the detector.
assymetry.c		--- Calculation/fit/plot of efficiency with assymetrical error bar.
